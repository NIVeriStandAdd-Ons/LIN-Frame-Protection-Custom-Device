LIN-Frame-Protection-Custom-Device

The LIN Frame Protection addon allows the user to easily select data channels for calculating a CRC or checksum. It creates and maps rolling counters and CRC/checksum channels to selected outgoing signals.


This Custom Device is based on the CAN-Frame-Protection-Custom-Device and modified for the LIN bus.
